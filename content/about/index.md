Hello, my name is Ari Ramdial.

I am a serial entrepreneur currently on sabbatical. I spend my days consulting for large asset managers like [PSP Investments](https://www.investpsp.com/en/). Previously, I founded the digital asset custodian [KNÃ˜X](https://kn0x.io/) for which I raised an $8.3M seed round from Fidelity Investments, iNovia Capital, and Initialized Capital. I live in Toronto.

I am interested in distributed systems, risk, algorithmic game theory, and functional programming.

I am dog-dad to Mika and Koa.
